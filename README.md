# Music Visualiser Project

Name: Nafeesa Naz

Student Number: C16715071

## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment

This project features the working of a ship which gets fired up as its engine starts after which you can see the dashboard of the ship along with its diagnostics and everything. The UI reacts to the noise in the mic of the device and processes it to change its background colour accordingly.
# Instructions

Run the main class after which you will be able to see a Java application window with the ship's engines firing up. Clicking anywhere on the window once the engine blades are fast enough will take you to the ship's dashboard where you will be able to see a simulation of the ship's system diagnostics.
# How it works

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
The thing that I am most proud about in this assignment is the how I have been able to get the UI to react to the input noise and change its colours according to the volume of the input  noise. When its too loud, the engine blades seem to get overheated as the background turns red and its normal when the noise is not very loud.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
